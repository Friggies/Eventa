# Eventa
Eventa is a CRUD application where you can create a user with your email address. With a user, you can create private or public events, change your events and optionally delete your events. You can explore other people's public events and if you choose to participate in another person's event, it will show up on your private profile so you do not forget.

*(If events have trouble fetching, or errors occur while creating an account, this could be due to Supabase deactivating the database due to inactivity.)*
